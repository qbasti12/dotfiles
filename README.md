To install these configs:

do "git clone https://github.com/qbasti12/dotfiles.git" in your terminal,
find the folder, that you cloned
and then just drag-and-drop all of the folders and files in your ~/.config folder. 

But you also have to install:
starship, 
caskaydia cove nerd font, 
fastfetch, 
hyprland(ofc), 
SwayNC (for notifications),
Wofi,
waybar,
kitty
and maybe (idk) the hyprland ecosystem. For the ecosystem i installed hyprpaper, hyprcursor, hyprlock and hypridle.
To install the cursors, you just need to drag and drop the .icons folder in your home folder (~)

Hope you like it!

Also, I changed the fastfetch to Arch and in starship, I changed the logo from EndeavourOS to Arch. 

Optional you can install Neovim, but only if you are using it. :)
