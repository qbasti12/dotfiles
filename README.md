To install these configs, just drag-and-drop all of the folders and files in your ~/.config folder. 
But you also have to install starship, caskaydia cove nerd font, fastfetch, hyprland(ofc), SwayNC (for notifications) and maybe (idk) the hyprland ecosystem. For the ecosystem i installed hyprpaper, hyprcursor, hyprlock and hypridle.
Hope you like it!

Also, I changed the fastfetch to Arch and in starship, I changed the logo from EndeavourOS to Arch.
